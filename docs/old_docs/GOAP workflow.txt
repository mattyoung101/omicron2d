## Workflow on robot
- Set goal state in setup
- Loop:
    - Collect sensor data
    - Update GOAP current state with new data
    - Is current GOAP state different?
        - Yes: generate new plan. Old plan would now probably be invalid.
    - Is current action complete?
        - Yes: did this action fail?
            - Yes: generate new plan from current world state
            - No: continue to next action in plan if not last action
        - No: continue executing current action
