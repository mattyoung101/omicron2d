# Team Omicron2D

Omicron2D aims to be a team competing in RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation. 
This repo contains the Kotlin code, running on the JVM, powering our rcssserver agent.

Omicron2D is related to Team Omicron, an official team competing in RoboCup Jr Open Soccer.
Omicron2D, however, is currently just an independent side-project consisting of only one member: me, Matt Young (software
engineer on the RoboCup Jr team). I'm always looking for more members, so if you're interested don't hesitate to get
in touch!

Contact Matt Young (matt.young.1@outlook.com) for any questions, queries, qualms or concerns.

## About the agents
If you want to know more about our agents, please check out some of the Markdown files in the docs folder (such as
PLANNING.md) and read the well-commented code. In the future when we're closer to the tournament, a team description
paper (TDP) will be prepared.

## Building/running
**To build:**

TBA: basically clone the project, open in IntelliJ and run Main.kt

**To run:**

TBA: more complicated, talk about command line parameters, etc.
