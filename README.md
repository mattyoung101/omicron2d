# Omicron2D

Omicron2D aims to be a team competing in RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation. It is currently in very early stages of development.
This repo contains the Kotlin code, running on the JVM, that powers our soccer agents.

Omicron2D is related to Team Omicron, an official team competing in RoboCup Jr Open Soccer.
Omicron2D, however, is currently just an independent side-project consisting of only one member: me, Matt Young (software
engineer on the RoboCup Jr team). If you feel like getting involved, don't hesitate to get in touch :)

If you have any questions, please contact Matt Young (matt.young.1@outlook.com).

## Project status
The project is just getting started. I have almost finished writing the parsers for incoming server messages (see, hear, etc), 
and soon I can move on to writing localisation and basic movement.

## About the agents
If you want to know more about our agents, please check out some Markdown files in the docs folder (such as
PLANNING.md) and/or read the code. In the future when we're closer to the tournament, a team description
paper (TDP) will be prepared.

## Building/running
**To build:**

TBA: basically clone the project, open in IntelliJ and run Main.kt

**To run:**

TBA: more complicated, talk about command line parameters, etc.
