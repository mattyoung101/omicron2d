# Team Omicron2D

Omicron2D aims to be a team competing in RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation. 
This repo contains the Kotlin code, running on the JVM, powering our rcssserver agent.

This team is a side project of Team Omicron, an official team competing in RoboCup Jr Open Soccer.
However, unlike that team, Omicron2D currently an independent project consisting of only one member (me, Matt Young, from Team Omicron).

Contact Matt Young (matt.young.1@outlook.com) for any questions, queries, qualms or concerns.
