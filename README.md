# Team Omicron2D

Omicron2D aims to be a team competing in RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation. 
This repo contains the Kotlin code, running on the JVM, powering our rcssserver agent.

Omicron2D is related to Team Omicron, an official team competing in RoboCup Jr Open Soccer.
We are currently an independent side-project consisting of only one member: me, Matt Young, software engineer
on Team Omicron. In the future, we may expand out to more members if any are interested.

Contact Matt Young (matt.young.1@outlook.com) for any questions, queries, qualms or concerns.
